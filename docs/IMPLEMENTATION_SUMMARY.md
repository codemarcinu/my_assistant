## Import Structure Fixes

### Problem Summary

The project had inconsistencies between the import structure in the application code and the file structure in the backend container. The code used two different import styles:
1. `from src.backend.xxx import yyy` - used in some files
2. `from backend.xxx import yyy` - dominant style in most files

This inconsistency caused import errors when running the application in the container environment because the Docker container copied files to the `/app` directory, and the directory structure did not include `src` as the parent directory for `backend`.

### Analysis Results

A detailed analysis of the import structure in the project revealed:

```
ðŸ“Š IMPORT COMPATIBILITY REPORT
============================================================
Files analyzed: 158
Total imports: 973
'src.backend' imports: 23
'backend' imports: 244
Other imports: 706
```

The analysis showed that:
1. Most imports in the project (244) used the `backend` format instead of `src.backend` (23)
2. Tests consistently used `backend` imports
3. A small number of files used the `src.backend` format

### Implemented Changes

Based on the analysis, all imports were standardized to the `backend` format (without the `src.` prefix), which was already the dominant pattern in the project. The following changes were made:

1. Updated the main.py file:
   ```python
   """
   Main application entry point.
   """

   import os
   import sys

   # Fix import paths
   project_root = os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__))
   if project_root not in sys.path:
       sys.path.insert(0, project_root)

   # Import the app from the backend module
   from backend.app_factory import create_app

   app = create_app()
   ```

2. Updated the Docker configuration to map the entire project directory:
   ```yaml
   volumes:
     - ./:/app  # Map the entire project directory
   ```

3. Created an automatic import update script (`update_imports.py`) that updated all imports from `src.backend` to `backend`. Results:
   ```
   Found 6 files with 'src.backend' imports
   Updated 24/24 imports in 6 files.
   ```

### Benefits

1. **Code Consistency** - Unified import style across the project
2. **Error Elimination** - Resolved import issues in the container
3. **Easier Maintenance** - Consistent import style for future maintenance
4. **Test Compatibility** - Aligned code with existing tests

## Docker Configuration Improvements

### Problem Summary

The Docker Compose configuration had several issues that made it difficult to run the development environment:

1. Outdated Docker Compose specification
2. Volume configuration problems, especially for node_modules in the frontend container
3. Inconsistent environment variables between containers
4. Missing dependencies between services
5. Incorrect URLs for communication between services

### Implemented Changes

1. Updated Docker Compose configuration:
   - Removed outdated version specification
   - Fixed volume configurations
   - Standardized environment variables with defaults
   - Added proper service dependencies
   - Corrected service URLs

2. Created a consolidated management script (`foodsave.sh`) that provides a unified interface for:
   - Starting the environment (with different profiles)
   - Checking status
   - Viewing logs
   - Stopping the environment

3. Improved container health checks and logging configuration

### Benefits

1. **Latest Standards Compliance** - Removed outdated version specification
2. **Better Data Isolation** - Proper volume configuration
3. **Environment Variable Consistency** - Using defaults and .env file
4. **Correct Service Dependencies** - Backend depends on postgres and ollama
5. **Easier Management** - Single script for all operations
6. **Error Resilience** - Automatic removal of conflicting containers
7. **Better Diagnostics** - Detailed service status information

## Project Structure Cleanup

### Changes Made

1. Removed redundant Docker Compose files:
   - `docker-compose.dev.yaml`
   - `docker-compose.dev.yml`

2. Removed redundant shell scripts:
   - `run_dev_docker.sh`
   - `stop_dev_docker.sh`
   - `status_dev_docker.sh`

3. Removed redundant Dockerfiles:
   - `Dockerfile.dev.backend`
   - `Dockerfile.dev`
   - `foodsave-frontend/Dockerfile.dev.frontend`

4. Consolidated Docker configuration into a single `docker-compose.yaml` file

5. Created a unified management script `foodsave.sh`

6. Updated documentation to reflect the changes

### Benefits

1. **Simplified Project Structure** - Fewer files to manage
2. **Consistent Configuration** - Single source of truth for Docker configuration
3. **Easier Onboarding** - Simpler commands for new developers
4. **Reduced Maintenance** - Fewer files to update when making changes

## Performance Optimizations

### Docker Image Optimizations

1. Used multi-stage builds to reduce image size
2. Implemented proper caching of dependencies
3. Added health checks for all services
4. Configured appropriate resource limits

### Application Optimizations

1. Improved import structure for faster startup
2. Configured proper logging levels
3. Added monitoring for performance metrics

## Conclusion

The implementation work has significantly improved the project structure, making it more consistent, easier to maintain, and more developer-friendly. The Docker configuration has been simplified and standardized, and the import structure has been unified across the project.

The new management script (`foodsave.sh`) provides a simple and intuitive interface for managing the environment, making it easier for new developers to get started and for experienced developers to work efficiently.
